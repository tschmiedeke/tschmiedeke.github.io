        <p class="date"><span>08.02.2013</span></p>
        <section class="content"><h6>Note: This was originally published on the <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/08/02/how-to-portfolio-sites-for-journalists-github-makes-em-cheap-and-kinda-easy/" target="_blank">Knight Lab blog</a>.</h6>
<p>Time and time again, new journalists are told to market themselves and make a brand for themselves. The new media heroes of the day have all done it — Nate Silver and his <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/">fivethirtyeight</a> brand, Andrew Sullivan and <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/">The Daily Dish</a>, Brian Stelter and <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/">TVNewser</a>, <a href="http://www.mthomps.com/">Matt Thompson</a>, <a href="http://katchow.com/">Kat Chow</a>, <a href="http://toure.com/">Touré</a>, <a href="http://about.me/danyelsmith">Danyel Smith</a> — the list goes on. Sometimes, though, all you need a static site to tell people who you are and what you do. You need a portfolio&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>The only problem is that hosting a website is hard work. Just registering a domain name requires navigating a labyrinth of menus and navigation bars designed in the early 2000s that do more to confuse than inform. And for those looking to host full blogs on WordPress or other platforms, it requires syncing a web host to a domain registrar, which can get even more&nbsp;confusing.</p>
<p>In Medill, students are instructed early to buy their own domain name and install a WordPress blog on it. While Medill has a special promotion with Dreamhost to lower the cost of entry for hosting for the first few months, many students drop their hosting plan when the cost becomes too expensive. Yet when internship and job application season comes around, they want a portfolio site to show off their&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Many turn back to WordPress and Dreamhost hosting, paying upwards of $10 per month to host what is essentially a static page on slow servers running WordPress. If the site does work, it is way too heavy for serving the purpose of linking readers to all of that student&#39;s work elsewhere on the web. Most times, a simple, static site will serve that purpose just fine. In fact, my own <a href="http://www.tylerjfisher.com/">website</a> is&nbsp;static. </p>
<p>What if I told you that, if you code your own website, you could host it <em>for free</em> on a much faster, reliable platform than Dreamhost? Hosting your website on <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>, the collaborative coding platform, not only provides free static hosting through GitHub Pages, but also encourages you to learn how to code properly using version&nbsp;control.</p>

<p>Last week, I launched my first team-developed <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/housing">news app</a> with a group of amazing student news nerds and peers: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hil_fung">Hilary Fung</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/danhillreports">Dan Hill</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kkrebeccalai">Rebecca Lai</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/shenghis">Sheng Wu</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ktzhu">Katie Zhu</a>. We developed <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/housing">a housing guide</a> for incoming freshmen to Northwestern University who are in the process of applying for freshman housing. It includes an interactive map of campus, filters to narrow down housing options, photos and videos of each hall, quotes from current residents and basic statistics including number of students, room size, cost and distance to key campus&nbsp;locations.</p>

<p>For about seven months, I have been developing <a href="http://www.northbynorthwestern.com/">my college publication’s</a> homebrew Django-based <span class="caps">CMS</span> (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.django-cms.org/">django-cms</a>). I suppose “maintain” would be the more appropriate word; I didn’t actually build the <span class="caps">CMS</span>. Instead, I’ve added a few features, subtracted a few useless ones and optimized for performance. These days, it works well, and my editors know how to use it effectively. But I’m&nbsp;frustrated.</p>
